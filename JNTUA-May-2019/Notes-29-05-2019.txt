Design a Procedure to check if a number is divisible by 9 and 11 but not by 10

99 is correct

990 is wrong

Design a procedure to calculate GCD(GCF, HCF) for two given numbers


while(n2 != 0)
{
	temp = n2
	n2 = n1 % n2
	n1 = temp
}

gcd = n1

for( i = 1; i <= n; i++)
	print i

Repeat Until(i > n)
	print i
	i++

table, lb, ub
10, 100, 105

10 x 100 = 1000
10 x 101 = 1010

Generation of N Prime Numbers

1. Checking if a number is a factor of another number
2. Check if a number is Prime
3. Generate N Primes

Recursion is expensive(Computation and time) when compared to Iteration


Recursive Function(parameters)
	base condition(smallest possible version of the same problem for which solution is known)

	Recursive Call(reduced parameter complexity)

power = 1
for(i = 1; i <= n; i++)
	power = power * a

PowerN(a, n):
	if(n == 0)
		return 1
	else
		return a * powerN(a, n-1)


Design a recursive procedure to calculate a ^ n
